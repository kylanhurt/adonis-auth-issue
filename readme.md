# crypto-investigation-reporting-app

## Introduction

It is a Forensic Crypto Investigation Reporting application. This application is designed for the victims and law enforcement agencies to record crypto transactions meticulously, add custom labels (to/from addresses, notes, etc.), and generate a comprehensive standardized report. Later, the report will be used by law enforcement agencies for legal filings and proceedings.

This application relies on one or more third-party APIs, such as CipherTrace API, BitQuery API, and many more, to provide vetted and accurate data for tracing crypto transactions.
