# Adonis 5 + React Auth (Web + Session) Example

Many of the AdonisJS examples online have their view portions generated by AdonisJS. As a frontend developer, I am used to working with Single-Page Applications (SPAs) like React, Vue, and Svelte. This example repo was created after many headaches caused by my lack of knowledge on topics like cookies and headers. I hope it helps someone out there... feel free to share!

## Frontend

You should just be able to do `yarn && yarn dev` from the `frontend` folder

## Backend

1.) Take a look at the `backend/.env` file and see what Postgres database and user you want to create

then you will need to run the following commands:

`yarn`

`node ace migration:run`

`yarn dev`

**Keep an eye on which ports React and Adonis are running on**
